# Brainstorming Session: utogsykle

**Date:** 2026-01-13
**Facilitator:** Mary (Business Analyst)
**Participant:** Tore

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Gamified corporate wellness competition platform - an always-on, company-controlled alternative to "Sykle til jobben"

**Goals:**
- Feature ideas we haven't thought of
- Business model clarity
- Technical considerations
- Potential risks and pitfalls
- Gamification design patterns

**Primary Heroes:** Employees and teams who participate

### Context Guidance

Based on research of "Sykle til jobben":
- Established 1973, ~40,000 annual participants
- Limited to 9-week annual campaign
- Basic gamification (3 points/day max)
- App issues (4.4 rating, UX complaints)
- Limited integrations (Strava/Polar only)

**Key Differentiation Opportunities:**
1. Always-on (not seasonal)
2. Company-controlled competitions
3. Advanced gamification
4. Better UX/app quality
5. More integrations

### Session Setup

**Approach Selected:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Rationale:** Complex multi-faceted challenge requiring targeted exploration of gamification design, SaaS business models, and risk identification.

---

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Gamified corporate wellness platform with focus on comprehensive exploration

**Recommended Techniques:**

1. **Role Playing:** Embody stakeholders (employees, HR, admins, competitors) to discover hidden needs and friction points
2. **Cross-Pollination:** Steal gamification patterns from gaming, fitness apps, social platforms, and unexpected industries
3. **Reverse Brainstorming:** Deliberately try to break ideas to reveal risks, blind spots, and edge cases

**AI Rationale:** Multi-faceted challenge requiring stakeholder empathy first, then creative innovation, concluding with risk identification to ensure comprehensive coverage.

### Technique 3: Reverse Brainstorming (29 failure mitigations)

#### User Adoption Failures
| # | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|------|------------|
| 1 | Fit people always win | Self-selected leagues (beginner/intermediate/advanced) |
| 2 | Fit people always win | Consistency > Performance (showing up beats one-time effort) |
| 3 | Fit people always win | Team averaging (not sum - prevents athlete stacking) |
| 4 | Cheaters ruin it | Outlier detection + hold until verified |
| 5 | Cheaters ruin it | Strava/Garmin required for competitive leagues |
| 6 | Cheaters ruin it | Full transparency - peer accountability |
| 7 | Cheaters ruin it | Daily point cap - grinding has limits |

#### Business/Churn Failures
| # | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|------|------------|
| 8 | Low adoption | Onboarding kit (emails, Slack messages, posters) |
| 9 | Low adoption | Adoption dashboard - trends over weeks |
| 10 | Low adoption | Social proof - "23 colleagues joined!" |
| 11 | Low adoption | Smart timing nudges to admin |
| 12 | Low adoption | Success manager check-ins (week 2, 6) |
| 13 | Price comparison | Competitive pricing (slightly higher OK for year-round) |
| 14 | Price comparison | Feature comparison matrix |
| 15 | Price comparison | Honest ROI (only claim with real data) |
| 16 | Price comparison | Year-round math (cost per week) |
| 17 | Price comparison | Free 1-month pilot (STRONGEST) |
| 18 | Price comparison | Flexibility argument (STRONGEST) |

#### Technical Failures
| # | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|------|------------|
| 19 | Security breach | Minimal data collection |
| 20 | Security breach | Never sell data - public promise |
| 21 | Security breach | Automated security monitoring |
| 22 | Security breach | Plain language privacy policy |
| 23 | Security breach | EU servers (nice-to-have) |
| 24 | Data loss | Daily backups + test restores |
| 25 | Data loss | Redundant storage (maybe) |
| 26 | Data loss | Immutable activity log (append-only) |
| 27 | Data loss | Soft delete (30 days recoverable) |

## Session Summary

**Session Completed:** 2026-01-13
**Duration:** ~90 minutes
**Ideas Generated:** 115
**Techniques Used:** Role Playing, Cross-Pollination, Reverse Brainstorming

### Key Insights

1. **"Consistency > Performance"** is the philosophical core - design for behavior change, not athletic competition

2. **Flexibility is the weapon** - year-round, custom competitions, fair systems - everything Sykle til jobben isn't

3. **Lars is the user** - design for the reluctant participant, not the fitness enthusiast

4. **Nina is the buyer** - she needs ROI proof, simple pricing, and a platform that won't embarrass her

5. **Erik is the gatekeeper** - if setup is painful, adoption fails before it starts

### Breakthrough Concepts

- **Activity Enablement** - not just tracking, but helping people DO activities
- **Winner Duels** - playoff structure creates narrative and excitement
- **Company vs Company Leagues** - external motivation + employer branding
- **Smart Timing Nudges** - become a partner, not just a tool
